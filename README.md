# Top News Live

Browse the latest news from Great Britain or United States.

The **Top News** page shows newest articles regardless of the subject while the **Categories** page shows news grouped into their relevant categories:

- Businesss
- Entertainment
- General
- Health
- Science
- Sports
- Technology

All the categories are displayed with a preview that shows the latest 5 news and can be navigated using the **<** and **>** buttons to cycle through the rest of the articles for that category. Also clicking the button next to the category name expands or collapses the full view with all the articles in that category listed.

The article page can be visited by clicking the **More>** link below the article description or anywhere on the article thumbnail in the case of category preview.

Searching for news is also available in the **Search** page, where the desired keywords can be typed into the form input field and upon pressing the _ENTER_ key a search will be initiated. When the search is finished, if results are found for the requested keywords, they will be displayed below the form.

At any point the country for which the news should be displayed or searched can be changed by controls in the top right corner of the header, buttons **GB** and **US**.
